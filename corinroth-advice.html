			<h3>Practice! Practice! Practice!</h3>
			<h4 id="left-col">Consistency is invaluable.  Make sure you practice everyday, it's the only real way to become proficient at coding.</h4>

			<p>"Skillcrush has given me the ability to excel at coding.  It's application of real world situations provides a practical approach to learning and allows for consistent daily practice. Never be afraid to ask for help! Each person began their journey very much in the same way- with a single <em>intrepid</em> step."</p>

			<h3>Never be afraid to ask questions!</h3>
			<h4 id="right-col">Always keep a list handy of useful resources. And when you get stuck (because you will) never be afraid to reach out for help.  Answers will always be close by as long as your willing to ask for them.</h4>

			<p>"As I began my journey into coding, I entered with steely determination, but quickly learned to accept confusion as a normal state of mind and realized I would not be able to do it alone.  The phrase <span id="phrase">"you don't know, what you don't know"</span> came to mind and forced me to seek advice whenever possible."</p>
